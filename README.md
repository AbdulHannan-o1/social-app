# 🌐 Social App

> 🚀 A simple **social media web app** built while switching from *legendary PHP* to the modern **Node.js + Express.js** stack!  
> This project is my practice ground for **server-side rendering**, **authentication & authorization**, and **cookie management** using EJS, JWT, and MongoDB.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- 📝 **Create an account** and **log in** using JWT-based authentication.  
- 💬 **Create posts**, **view others’ posts**, and **leave comments**.  
- 🍪 Manage **cookies** for authentication tokens.  
- 🎨 Enjoy a **server-side rendered** interface using **EJS** with **TailwindCSS** for styling.

It’s a hands-on learning project where I explore the power of **Node.js** and **Express** to handle backend logic that I once used to do in PHP — but now, the JavaScript way! ⚡

## 💡 Motivation

This project marks my transition from PHP to Node.js.
It’s where I started understanding how Express.js handles routing, JWT authentication, and SSR with EJS — building the same concepts I loved in PHP but in a much more scalable and modern way. 😄
